Connect to Big Blue Button
================================================================================

#. After joining the session you will be asked how you would like to set up
   your audio.

#. Select the "Microphone" option, since "Listen only" will not allow you to speak

#. Your browser will ask you to confirm microphone access for the site.

   **Important**: you will need to allow this permission, if you'd like others
   to be able to hear you

#. Connecting to echo test

   This step may take up to 1 min.

   **Note**: ideally you should have a direct connection to the Internet,
   especially the use of VPNs may interfere with establishing a connection.

#. You may test the connection by saying something out loud. If your
   microphone is set up correctly, you should hear yourself back.

   **Note**: in case you have multiple microphones connected to your PC, your
   browser will select whichever is designated as default.

   If you heard yourself talking, the echo test is successful.

   If not, click on the red "thumbs down" icon and in the following dialog you
   may select another microphone.

#. At this point you have joined the session.

   Because of privacy considerations, your microphone is muted by default.

   Use the microphone icon on the bottom to enable your audio.

   **Note**: the controls in this group:

   - Switch on/off the microphone
   - Leave audio -- if pressed you will be in "Listen only" mode. To use the
     microphone you will need to repeat the steps of the echo test.
   - Switch on/off your webcam
   - Star/stop sharing your desktop or an application window (only appears if
     you have the "Presenter" role)

#. If the microphone is enabled you may speak. If your audio is set up
   correctly others will be able to hear you. Note that your name will flash
   on the top of the screen every time you say something.

Enable your webcam
================================================================================

#. After clicking the enable webcam button, your browser will search for
   available webcams on your laptop/computer.

   **Note**: similar to the microphone, the browser will need your explicit
   permission to use the webcam.

   .. figure:: images/bbb-connect-08.png
      :width: 80%
      :alt: a function is a black box

#. In this dialog you may select the webcam that you'd like to use. There are
   3 video quality settings you may select from. Usually the default "Medium
   quality" option is a good compromise between picture quality and bandwidth
   usage.

   **Note**: make sure that no other application of browser window is using
   your webcam.

#. After clicking the "Start sharing" button it may take a few seconds for
   your picture to appear on the top of the screen.

Focusing on a person or a shared application
================================================================================

#. Grab the divider to grow/shrink the webcam pictures vs. the shared slides.

   .. figure:: images/bbb-connect-11.png

      :alt: a function is a black box

#. In this example the section of the screen showing webcams and shared
   applications is larger, the slides are smaller.

   If you want to focus on a person, use the small strip at the bottom of
   their webcam window to enlarge.
